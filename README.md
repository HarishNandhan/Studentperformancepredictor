# Student Performance Predictor

Overview
Student Performance Predictor is a web application that predicts the math score of a student based on their gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. The application is built using Flask framework in Python and uses a machine learning model trained on student performance data to make predictions.

## Features
Predicts the math score of a student based on various factors
User-friendly interface with attractive design and cool pictures
Easy-to-use form for inputting student data
Real-time prediction of math score using machine learning model
Online images and CSS styling for the design
